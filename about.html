                <div class="bio">Skye Sajous is our REACT I front-end developer. She specializes in creating amazing web
                    products and getting things done. She uses her creative intuition in her day to day life by painting
                    murals of trilobytes and designing starships. Her hobbies include deep sea diving and whittling.

                <div class="bio">Rae Glazier is our REACT II front-end developer. She excels in making projects
                    efficient and accessible. When she's not slowly taking control of the internet, she raises two kids
                    and teaches dead languages to toddlers. Her army of tiny polyglots is the pride of her hometown and
                    the envy of professional historians everywhere.</div>

                <div class="bio">Marcos Lira is our back-end developer. He brings the functionality of our product to
                    the next level using his awesome programming skills. He enjoys cross-country skiing, making
                    miniature oil paintings with a single-haired paintbrush, and solving the mysteries of an unknowable
                    universe. </div>

                <div class="bio">Katrina Hernandez is our web/UI developer. She created the design of the site itself.
                    She doesn't know a lot about programming yet, but she enjoys crying to her roommate's cats about
                    complicated Javascript problems. In her non-existant free time, she enjoys reading, solving puzzles,
                    and writing incessant e-mails to Netflix demanding more Witcher.</div>

                <div class="bio">Leslie Thompson is our fearless leader. She corrales the developers, establishes group
                    documentation and version control, sets timelines and makes everything run smoothly. We would be
                    lost without her organizational and technical expertise. If she weren't busy running this and other
                    projects, she'd be crafting gourmet pho and writing another book of poetry.</div>
