                    Baado can improve efficiency for the lenders at Tieme Ndo by creating a database which includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ability to add a new client including their name, village, loan amount, loan initiation date and due
                          date.</li>
                        <li>Ability to edit or delete client information.</li>
                        <li>Home page to see all added clients and filter by client names, village, and loan due date.</li>
                        <li>Ability to go into a client’s profile and update their recent payment amounts. This will update a
                          view to show how much money they still owe on the loan.</li>
                        <li>Ability to go into a client’s profile and add the number of bags of maize they were able to harvest,
                          and the number of bags they make a goal to sell.</li>
